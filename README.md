# Orderbird Team Day

Greetings human! You have been selected to test your skills among mortals called 'DevOps' :)

This repository contains a directory with a `Java` project, it uses `Gradle` to resolve our package dependencies. Also, the project was built using `Spring Boot`. The application has some *errors* that we made on *purpose*, you should fix them in order to make the Spring application work properly.

After fixing the error, add a `Dockerfile` & a `docker-compose` where it defines how you want to deploy this application and run it within a container.

At the end, we expect to run your solutions easily! We want to be able to access locally via http://localhost:8080

* +1: If you create a Makefile with rules that abstract many steps to bring your solution to life
* +1: Write a clear and concise documentation explaining how to run your solution.
